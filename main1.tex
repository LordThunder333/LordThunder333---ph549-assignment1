\section{Problem 1}
In what follows, $r$ is the radius of the hemispherical caps,$l$ the length and $m$ of the cell. It is given that, 
$$r=0.5\mu \text{m}$$
$$l=2\mu \text{m}$$
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Volume is given by $$V=\pi r^2 l + \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3} = 2.094 \mu \text{m}^{3}$$
  Typical cell volume is $0.6-0.7 \mu \text{m}^{3}$

  \item $m$ is the sum of the mass of water contained and that of the other substances. Since, density of water is $$10^3 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}=10^{-6} \frac{\text{pg}}{\mu \text{m}^3}$$
  We have
  $$m=10^{-6} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3} + 1.3\cdot \frac{1}{3}\right)\cdot V \text{pg} = 2.304 \cdot 10^{-3} \text{pg}$$
  
  Typical cell weight is $1\cdot 10^{-3} \text{pg}$ \newline \url{https://ecmdb.ca/e_coli_stats)}

It is evident from the above calculations, that the it is the assumed shape of \textit{E. coli} which deviates greatly from what is true.

\section{Problem 2}
    Let at the end of $9^{\text{th}}$ cycle there be $N$ nuclei at the surface. At the end of $13^{\text{th}}$ cycle, therefore there are $16N$ nuclei, which is given as $\approx 6000$. Hence, $$N \approx 375$$
    Since, every embryo must start from a single fertilized nucleus, at the end of $9^{\text{th}}$ cycle, there must be $2^{9} = 512$ nuclei in total. Therefore, the fraction of nuclei which migrated to the surface is$$\frac{375}{512} \approx 0.7324$$
    Following the notation of Problem 1, surface area of the spherocylinder is $$A=4\pi r^{2} + 2\pi r l = 4.3982\cdot 10^{-7} \text{m}^{2}$$ 
    Therefore, the areal density is $$1.3642\cdot10^{10} \frac{\text{nuclei}}{\text{m}^2}$$
    (For the next part, I have used Mathematica.)
    To calculate the length of the green strips, I marked the ends of widths along the lenghts of each strip, and then used the given scale.

\end{figure} \newline
    Length of the green strip is: $18.37 \pm 4.99 \mu \text{m}$
    To evaluate the number of nuclei in each strip, I isolated the colors, and counted the number of pixels.

    Therefore, the number of nuclei corresponding to each dye(I'm considering only a single surface)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Red: 148
        \item Green: 210
        \item Blue: 58

\section{Problem 4}
The probability of having $0$ and $6$ is $$p^{3}q^{3}$$. 
The probability of having $1$ and $5$ is 
$$\binom{3}{1}p^{4}q^{2}+\binom{3}{1}p^{2}q^{4}$$
The probability of having $2$ and $4$ in one cell is
$$\binom{3}{2}p^{5}q^{1}+\binom{3}{2}p^{1}q^{5}+\binom{3}{1}\binom{3}{1}p^{3}q^{3}$$
The probability of having $3$ in one cell is
$$p^{6}+q^{6}+\binom{3}{1}\binom{3}{2}p^{2}q^{4}+\binom{3}{2}\binom{3}{1}p^{4}q^{2}$$
By substituting $p=0.5+x$, and minimizing using the least-squares method with respect to the experimental distribution, obtained value for p is $0.936093$.
Attached, is a scatter plot showing the deviation. Given that, there are only 6 molecules, and the error is about $0.007 \pm 0.001$ (for the non-zero values), I believe it's a good model. \newline

\section{Problem 5}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item There are $4^3$ possible ways of choosing the bases to form a triplet, each with the same probability. Therefore, $$p_{s}=\frac{3}{64}$$
    % \item Let's find the probability for an unacceptable possibility. Let after $x$ bases, we get our first T base. This can be done in $3^x$ ways. We can obtain stop-codon in $3$ ways. We have $3\times N - x - 3$ bases left. These can be obtained in $4^{3N-x-3}$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways we can get an unacceptable possibility is:
    % $$\Sigma_{x=0}^{3N-3}\left(3^{x+1}4^{3N-x-3}\right)=3\times4^{3N-3}\left(\frac{1-(\frac{3}{4})^{3N-2}}{\frac{1}{4}}\right)$$
    % Therefore, the acceptable number of possibilities are:
    % $$13\cdot4^{3N-2}+3^{3N-1}$$
    % Therefore, required probability is:
    % $$\frac{13}{16} + \frac{1}{3}\cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{3N}$$
	\item There are 64 possible codons. Three of these are not allowed(The stop codons), to form an ORF.Therefore, the number of acceptable possibilities is $(64-3)^{N}$.\newline
	Required probability is $\left(\frac{61}{64}\right)^{N}$.
	\item Codons are of length $3$ bases. Since, the DNA is circular, let us pick an arbitray base and call it the starting point, and label the bases as $$\dots x_{N-1}x_{N}x_{0}x_{1}x_{2}\dots$$
    Looking at the above sequence, we can see that the codons containing $x_{0}$ are
    \begin{align*}
        & x_{N-1}x_{N}x_{0} \\
        & x_{N}x_{0}x_{1} \\
        & x_{0}x_{1}x_{2} \\
    \end{align*} and their reverse(corresponding to either a clockwise read or an anti-clockwise read -- Also respectively, each codon corresponds to reading frames: $+2$,$+1$ and $+0$). Therefore, there are $6$ reading frames in total.
